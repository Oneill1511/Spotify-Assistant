Download the .Exe file, 
IF planning to use you'll need your own web API Key 
https://developer.spotify.com/ 
Free, Easy to set up, 


you'll also need to copy code into Pycharm, (im using 3.11) 
under def main() : 
you'll need to enter your own Client ID & Secret, as well as URL redirect, this can be found under your dashboard on Spotify website found via link above. 

i would use this as an intergration to a larger Assistant, worked well with T5 Handeler model, or SpaCy.
